# Rubiks-Cube-Solver
Rubik's Cube Solver takes an input cube and produces a solution using the beginners method. Input and output are both managed via JOptionPanes. This project is a bit old, might rewrite it in the near future.
# Known bugs
* Some states result in a non terminating loop of instructions.
